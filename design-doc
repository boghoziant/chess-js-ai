1. Create a move generation and board visualiation algorithm
 - Initially play against a random move generator
 - pick randomly from list of possible moves

2. Position Evaluation
 - Get list of possible moves 
 - Assign each one a value by counting all
the pieces on the board
 - Pick highest value move
 - Currently this just means capturing the highest 
value target

3. Search Tree using MiniMax
