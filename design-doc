1. Create a move generation and board visualiation algorithm
 - Initially play against a random move generator
 - pick randomly from list of possible moves

2. Position Evaluation
 - Get list of possible moves 
 - Assign each one a value by counting all
the pieces on the board
 - Pick highest value move
 - Currently this just means capturing the highest 
value target

3. Search Tree using MiniMax
 - Minimax algorithm calculates the state of the board
using the evaluation function and finds the next best
move using that same function. Then it recusively
calls the eval function again searching for the best
move for the opposing player. 
 - Need to change eval function to selectively minimize
or maximize.

4. Use alpha-beta pruning
